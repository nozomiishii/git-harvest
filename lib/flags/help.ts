  return `git-harvest cleans up worktrees and branches based on commit lifecycle stage.

Stages (risky -> safe):
  files-changed  ->  committed  ->  merged

  A worktree/branch is classified by its most at-risk stage (uncommitted changes win).
  A flag lowers the threshold and deletes that stage and everything safer; merged is the safe default.
  "untouched" (no work, identical to base) and "detached" (no branch) sit off this ladder:
  kept by default, removed by --untouched / --detached (or --yolo).

Usage: git-harvest [options]

Options:
  -h, --help                  Show this help
  -v, --version               Show version
  -n, --dry-run               Show what would be deleted without deleting

  --committed[=<scope>]       Delete from committed (committed + merged). scope: worktree,
                              claude-worktree, branch (default: all).
  --files-changed[=<scope>]   Delete from files-changed (uncommitted included). scope: worktree,
                              claude-worktree (default: all worktree scopes).
                              Multiple scopes: comma-separated or repeat the flag.
  --untouched                 Delete untouched worktrees (no work, identical to base; off-ladder).
  --detached                  Delete detached worktrees (no branch; off-ladder).
                              WARNING: a detached worktree's commits are unreachable -- removal can
                              lose them permanently (no reflog recovery).

  --yolo                      Preset: --files-changed --committed --untouched --detached (all scopes).
                              WARNING: removes uncommitted changes and detached commits (see --detached).

Subcommands:
  logo                        Show the git-harvest logo

Invariants are always protected (no flag or --yolo can override):
  main/default worktree, worktree on the base branch, current cwd worktree, locked worktree,
  worktree with a running agent session, current HEAD branch, branch checked out in a surviving worktree.
